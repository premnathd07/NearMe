    <p>The Krishna River is one of India’s major rivers, flowing about 1,300 kilometers from the Western Ghats in Maharashtra to the Bay of Bengal. It passes through the states of Karnataka, Telangana, and Andhra Pradesh, supporting agriculture, drinking water, and hydroelectric projects along its course. Known for its cultural and historical significance, the river nourishes fertile plains and is central to many communities and traditions in southern India.</p>
